	<Bori_B1.description>Year 5012. An international convention on the human rights of mosaic babies, a colloquial name for babies and children created from genetic engineering. It was held in New London on the occasion of the 199th birthday of Queen Eleanor II. Originally, the convention was held to create an agreement for the human rights of mosaic babies, but the convention was canceled after Eleanor II, who was attending the event, fell down a flight of stairs and died.

	<Bori_B2.description>Year 5013. Bellinogate was a large-scale corruption case occurring during the Duke Bellino's succession to the throne. After taking the throne, he cut off a large amount of support to the late queen's Fashion Gene Research Institute. Researchers and scientists at the institute protested unfair and unpaid wages, and Bellino would soon after get into controversy regarding tax evasion and sexual assault allegations. Eventually, a conspiracy theory was brought to light that accused Bellino of the assassination of late Queen Eleanor II, which threw all of Tobem into political chaos.</Bori_B2.description>

	<Bori_B3.label>5043.\nThe Bori</Bori_B3.label>
	<Bori_B3.description>Year 5043. The first report dealing with an unidentified genetically engineered race emerges as thousands of members occupy an abandoned houses in Tobem. These illegal occupants were dubbed "Boy's&#160;Organization&#160;of&#160;Resident&#160;Intrusion/Invasion", later shortened to "Bori". Many people reported this problem to the king and demanded he acknowledged the seriousness of the problem as soon as possible

"What's the problem with them living in an empty house that no one lives in anyway? The people of Tobem are suffering in urban slums because houses are being made that are too expensive for them to buy, so they are forced to look for cheaper options."</Bori_B3.description>

	<Bori_B3_1.label>5044.\nLambs of Demarcia</Bori_B3_1.label>
	<Bori_B3_1.description>Year 5044. This was the newspaper headline about a type of mosaic baby known as Sheepawn, who made an appearance at the Demarcia Fashion Show held in Tobem every year.\nA lovely figure, a beautiful voice, a breathtaking face, soft hair, and a pair of eye-catching horns... what's there not to love?\nThe Sheepawns took the audience's breath away as they walked down the runway. No one could speak, but everyone noticed...\n\n"Those weren't decorations... Those were real horns！"</Bori_B3_1.description>

	<Bori_B4.label>5045.\nE.D.E.N. International Space Defense Treaty</Bori_B4.label>
	<Bori_B4.description>Year 5045. Two years ago, as riots and protests were breaking out over	the Bori, a spy ship was observed approaching Eden from outer space. Tobem and the rest of the countries of Eden banded together to overcome the potential crisis, and each of the world's leaders signed the International Space Defence Treaty at Berzac Observatory. It was later discovered that the spy ship belonged to an alien race of genetically engineered ant people.</Bori_B4.description>

	<Bori_B5.label>4.21.\nTobem Military Coup</Bori_B5.label>
	<Bori_B5.description>April 21st of Year 5045. The knowledge that alien reconnaissance ships have been observed in orbit fueled political and military unrest in Tobem. The army officers of the military staged a coup and took control of Tobem. The new military regime, led by Major General Kasazm, was established within thirty years. Recognizing the potential of the fertility and territorial nature of Bori, who had grown to account for 30% of the population of Tobem within those thirty years, Kasazm promised the Bori sovereignty and homes in exchange for their loyalty to the military and a promise to protect Eden from external threats.

	<Bori_B5_1.label>6.28.\nThe Green Wives' Society</Bori_B5_1.label>
	<Bori_B5_1.description>The Green Wives' Society was a movement-turned-cultural symbol that represented the woman who took the place of men in various industrial fields as the men were conscripted by the military regime. Alongside Bori, Sheepawns who were hidden by society restored the extensively collapsed economy of Tobem. This started civil rights discussion about the value and role of women in society, which became a bright hope for those who had been neglected or discriminated against in society.\n\n"Ivy flowers aren't considered beautiful, but their strong stems support crumbling walls firmly and silently.\nWe are the ivy flowers,\nits stem,\nits seeds,\nand its hope."</Bori_B5_1.description>

	<Bori_O1.label>5100.\nThe Orion Award</Bori_O1.label>
	<Bori_O1.description>Year 5100, autumn. The Orion Award is the most prestigious award one can receive on Eden, which was created to commemorate the achievements of Ms. Orion, who invented "orion" by using the wool from Sheepawns known as "aries" and plasteel.\nMs. Orion worked in her laboratory for 48 years to find the key to ending the Hundreds' Year War, and as a result of her devotion, she was able to synthesize a new material that was extremely light, strong, and resistant to both the heat and the cold.\nThis material was named orion after its creator and was immediately put to use on the battlefield, where it served as Eden's greatest lifeline.\n\n"Please, don't praise me.\nThis achievement was only possible thanks to the dedicated young men on the battlefield,\nwho sacrificed their lives to save their homes and their loved ones."</Bori_O1.description>

	<Bori_B6.label>Hundred Years' War</Bori_B6.label>
	<Bori_B6.description>War. War is like a river. It's course can't be changed by one person, and it seems to go on endlessly. The Bori pledged their allegiance to the military regime, and the National Guard and the Imperial Guard were established. These Bori were sent out on the frontlines for 100 years, endlessly protecting Eden from the alien invaders... For what? The reason for the war was eventually completely lost to history, and Eden was left a wasteland.
	
"Imperial Guards, never forget the ivy vine."</Bori_B6.description>

	<Bori_B7.label>1.\nRefugee Relief and Relocation Act</Bori_B7.label>
	<Bori_B7.description>The Refugee Relief and Relocation Act was signed by AOC (An Orbital planet purification Company) with the remaining survivors on Eden. In return for the help from AOC, the few survivors, the National Guard, and the Imperial Guard who remained on Eden were tasked with relocating to the outer planets of outlying systems to investigate planetary habitability and construct outposts. Although they could not save their first home, perhaps their fate on the rimworlds would be different.

	<Bori_C1.label>5176.\nThe Chocolate Truce</Bori_C1.label>
	<Bori_C1.description>Year 5176. The Chocolate Truce was signed in the western plains of a rimworld. The Grape Candy Hive agreed to suspend all war activities for 10 years in exchange for 380 million VKC of chocolate from Eden.\nThey promised to release and restore all supply routes and communication networks that had previously been occupied.\n\nThe Grape Candy Hive faithfully implemented this truce; however, it quickly fell through due to a preemptive nuclear warhead strike on Eden.</Bori_C1.description>

	<Bori_WC_Base.label>5176.\nAbove Unknown Lands</Bori_WC_Base.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base.description>Year 5176. An previously unidentified planet was encountered by the few remaining members of the AOC Group's deep space team on the way to being reassigned to a border planet in accordance with the AOC Group's Frontier Refugee Relocation Treaty.\nAccording to the interstellar navigator, the planet had never been unexplored by humanity up until that point. After some discussion, they decided to immediately change course and approach the mysterious blue planet.\n\n"Like a moth to light, we are drawn to the unknown."</Bori_WC_Base.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_B1.label>5.7.\nGhost Planet</Bori_WC_B1.label>
	<Bori_WC_B1.description>May 7th of Year 5176. The exploration team that entered the planet's atmosphere was astonished. "Welcome to Wisteria!" their probe chirped. Advertisements for major tourist attractions and cities poured in. Beautiful architecture made with the most cutting-edge technology, nature seemingly coexisting in the cities, floating islands, wild blue crystal flowers. While the exploration team pondered why the planet was unregistered in the interstellar navigator, it slowly dawned on them.\n\nThere was no trace of any living person.\nNot a single one appeared on any bioscans.\n\n"It looks like we arrived on a ghost planet."</Bori_WC_B1.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_Base_B2.label>6.3.\nAge of Innocence</Bori_WC_Base_B2.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base_B2.description>June 3rd of Year 5176. The exploration team tracked the planet's energy distribution map and moved to the most concentrated area.\nUsually, large-scale power generation facilities are located near the sea, and for their safety, it was necessary to make sure these facilties were still stable.\n\nHowever, this case was a little different. According to the distribution map, the power generation facilities were located inland, not along the coast.\n\nBy tracking them, they discovered a military based that had been owned and operated by the Wisteria Corporation, a private military company protected by a strict, automatued security system, in the interior region of the planet, Wisteria.\n\n\nThe exploration team safely entered the military base without activating the security system. While looking for a way to enter, the probe received a messaged from Wisteria Corporation's AI, requesting communication.\n\n"Mosaic babies? Who are you?"</Bori_WC_Base_B2.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_Base_B3.label>5179.\nAnd then there were none</Bori_WC_Base_B3.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base_B3.description>Year 5179. It identified itself as a general AI of the corporation, and revealed that the planet, Wisteria was privately owned by the Wisteria Corporation, which operated as a private military arms dealer. It asked, "What kind of organization is the AOC (An Orbital planet purification Company) group?"\n"Why did you visit Wisteria?"\n\nThe deep space exploration team briefly informed the AI that Wisteria was not located on the navigator, that they were the first to find the planet in what appeared to be a long while, and the tragedy that had occurred on Eden at the hand of the Ants.\n\nWary of the exploration team but with few other options, Wisteria's AI asked them for help.\n\n"The people living on this planet... they all evaporated in an instant.\nAll at the exact same time, with no warning."</Bori_WC_Base_B3.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_Base_B4.label>5180.\nInvisible Hand</Bori_WC_Base_B4.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base_B4.description>Year 5180. Since then, the exploration team has explored every corner of Wisteria with the help of Wisteria's AI.\n\nThere is a unique species of plant native to the planet known as the blue crystal flower.\nThis flower absorbs energy from the planet's ley lines. Miraculously, it can stably store enormous amounts of energy.\nUsing these seemingly innocuous flowers for energy storage, the Wisteria Corporation was able to quickly rise to become one of the best private military companies in the galaxy.\n\nWhile reverse-engineering the company's technologies, the exploration team toured the planet's major cities to search for any traces of human life, but none were found.\n\n"Strictly speaking, it wasn't just humans who evaporated. They must have been wearing clothes or implants. But they were gone, too. There must be some rule, some pattern to this..."</Bori_WC_Base_B4.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_Base_B5.label>11.7.\nUnder the Oak Tree</Bori_WC_Base_B5.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base_B5.description>November 7th of Year 5180. Four years had passed since the exploration team landed on Wisteria.\n\nQuadruplets were born to Mr. and Mrs. MacDodge, both members of the exploration team.\n\nIt was a monumental event. The first beings born on the planet since the mysterious disappearance of people.\n\nThe MacDodge couple, who were devout Neo-Christians, asked Wisteria's AI if it could guide them to a nearby church to baptize their children. Wisteria's AI hesitated before speaking.\n\n"I have no data on 'churches.' Can you explain?"</Bori_WC_Base_B5.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_Base_B6.label>12.25.\nGolden Branch</Bori_WC_Base_B6.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base_B6.description>December 25th of Year 5180. There was silence.\nIt was normal for religions to not be practiced on every planet, but for Wisteria's AI to have never heard of such a popular religion was strange. How isolated was this planet? How divergent was their history? Did the disappearance of the people here predate Neo-Christianity?\n\nAttempting to understand more, the team searched through the planet's records and even the AI's memory, but they found that the majority was corrupted and distorted beyond repair.\nWhile the team believed in rights for AI, but they realized how dangerous the technology, and by extension, the AI was.\n\nThe AI understood the situation, and spoke softly.\n\n"I see... Perhaps it's time for a change."</Bori_WC_Base_B6.description>
	
	<Bori_WC_Base_B7.label>0.\nFrom the Right</Bori_WC_Base_B7.label>
	<Bori_WC_Base_B7.description>Whatever the truth was, there was only one answer in the end.\n\nThe exploration team from Eden needed a new home where their compatriots could live. Realizing that their interests coincided, the exploration team and Wisteria's AI finally agreed to share their confidential infomation and data. Less than two seconds after the data sharing began, something unbelievable happened. Wisteria's AI had shut down and completely stopped operating. The exploration team frantically tried to restart Wisteria's AI, but it was all for nought. After a few days, the exploration team gave up on restarting the AI and decided to look up the logs that were last viewed by the AI.\n\n"ITPM: Winchester 32 Self-Evaluation Report..."\n\n"ITPM was the first interstellar company to conduct research on the mind wave phenomenon before the AOC Group."\n\n"So..."\n\n"That was a hundred or two hundred years ago, right? Considering the time when we were in the hibernation tubes... An entire matrilineal line had disappeared without a trace. They were deemed missed at that time."</Bori_WC_Base_B7.description>
