	<description>An English transation for the Bori race mod. Made at the request of OttersHoldHands.

Lovingly hand translated by me, who cross-referenced Lucifel's Japanese translation with the original Korean in order to create an accurate, but localized English translation. Enjoy!

Original mod blurb:
Imperial Guard, remember the ivy.

Paradise no longer exists.
Their home planet, Eden, was destroyed by a race of ant-like aliens long ago. Now, only stories of it ripple throughout the rimworlds of the outer systems.

But they survived!
Their forefathers signed the Refugee Relief and Relocation Act, sending clusters of Bori and Sheepawn from their war-torn planet, to the outer reaches of the galaxy. Now, they will fight against those who destroyed their home, building new communities, new weapons, new defenses, until they can finally rebuild their paradise!</description>
