  <SP_Weave.description>Raw wool from a Sheepawn. Processing is necessary to turn it into useable fabric.
Fabric made from Sheepawn wool was considered the finest available on Eden. It is incredibly soft and luxurious and is considered beyond beautiful with it's light color and faint shine. Aries shrinks in cold weather, providing excellent heat insulation, and expands in hot weather, allowing for improved heat dissipation.</SP_Weave.description>
