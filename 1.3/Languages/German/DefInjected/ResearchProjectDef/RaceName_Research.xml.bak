  <Bori_B5.label>4.21.\nTobem Military Coup</Bori_B5.label>
  <Bori_B5.description>April 21st of Year 5045. The knowledge that alien reconnaissance ships have been observed in orbit fueled political and military unrest in Tobem. The army officers of the military staged a coup and took control of Tobem. The new military regime, led by Major General Kasazm, was established within thirty years. Recognizing the potential of the fertility and territorial nature of Bori, who had grown to account for 30% of the population of Tobem within those thirty years, Kasazm promised the Bori sovereignty and homes in exchange for their loyalty to the military and a promise to protect Eden from external threats.

  <Bori_B5_1.label>6.28.\nThe Green Wives' Society</Bori_B5_1.label>
  <Bori_B5_1.description>The Green Wives' Society was a movement-turned-cultural symbol that represented the woman who took the place of men in various industrial fields as the men were conscripted by the military regime. Alongside Bori, Sheepawns who were hidden by society restored the extensively collapsed economy of Tobem. This started civil rights discussion about the value and role of women in society, which became a bright hope for those who had been neglected or discriminated against in society.\n\n"Ivy flowers aren't considered beautiful, but their strong stems support crumbling walls firmly and silently.\nWe are the ivy flowers,\nits stem,\nits seeds,\nand its hope."</Bori_B5_1.description>

  <Bori_B6.label>Hundred Years' War</Bori_B6.label>
  <Bori_B6.description>War. War is like a river. It's course can't be changed by one person, and it seems to go on endlessly. The Bori pledged their allegiance to the military regime, and the National Guard and the Imperial Guard were established. These Bori were sent out on the frontlines for 100 years, endlessly protecting Eden from the alien invaders... For what? The reason for the war was eventually completely lost to history, and Eden was left a wasteland.

  <Bori_B7.label>1.\nRefugee Relief and Relocation Act</Bori_B7.label>
  <Bori_B7.description>The Refugee Relief and Relocation Act was signed by AOC (An Orbital planet purification Company) with the remaining survivors on Eden. In return for the help from AOC, the few survivors, the National Guard, and the Imperial Guard who remained on Eden were tasked with relocating to the outer planets of outlying systems to investigate planetary habitability and construct outposts. Although they could not save their first home, perhaps their fate on the rimworlds would be different.
